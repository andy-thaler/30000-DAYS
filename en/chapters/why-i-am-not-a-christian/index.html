<h1>Why I Am Not a “Christian”</h1>
<div class="meta">Book chapter · Public edition</div>

<hr />

<h2>Author’s Position</h2>

<p>This text expresses the <strong>informed and responsible position of a single author</strong>, grounded in direct observation of reality, in the historical record, in the biblical record, and in the accumulated experience of humanity throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>It is not presented as speculation nor as an ideological construct, but as a <strong>verified and re-verified conviction</strong>, confirmed by its fruits, by its internal coherence, and by its consistency with the truth revealed in Scripture.</p>

<p>The author <strong>assumes full responsibility for what is stated here</strong>, without revealing personal identity—not as evasion, but as <strong>prudence</strong>, in a world where speaking truth may entail unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>The validity of what is expressed here <strong>does not depend on the identity of the author</strong>, but on its fidelity to truth, to observable reality, and to the testimony that runs consistently through human history.</p>

<p><strong>GOD IS</strong>, and GOD is witness to all things, because He knows all and sees all.</p>

<h2>Chapter</h2>

<p>I am not a Christian.<br>
I do not say this as an attack, nor as provocation, nor as a rejection of God.<br>
I say it calmly, coherently, and with full awareness of what I am saying.</p>

<p>I believe in GOD. I believe that GOD IS—always has been and always will be.<br>
I believe in Yeshua, the Christ.<br>
Precisely because of this, I do not identify with what is today called <em>Christianity</em>.</p>

<p>I once imagined a scene: I was being interviewed by a group of people. They asked me why I was not a Christian if I claimed to believe in God. My answer was simple—almost uncomfortable in its obviousness:</p>

<p><strong>Because they claim to be Christians, yet they do not even keep the Sabbath.</strong></p>

<p>The reaction was exaggerated: nervous laughter, raised arms, microphones in the air—a chorus of surprise and mockery. Not because the answer was absurd, but because it was too simple. It had been in front of them the whole time.</p>

<p>And then the inevitable question arises:<br>
Who kept the Sabbath?</p>

<p><strong>Yeshua.</strong><br>
The Christ.<br>
He kept it.</p>

<p>Not as empty ritual, not as religious burden, not as institutional formalism—but as what it truly is: <strong>rest</strong>.</p>

<p>The commandment of the Sabbath is not merely about a day. It is about rest.<br>
And the connection becomes unavoidable:<br>
Who is the rest?</p>

<blockquote>
“Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”
</blockquote>

<p>Rest.</p>

<p>The Sabbath points to rest, and rest points to Christ. Christ did not abolish the Sabbath; He <strong>fulfilled</strong> it. True rest is not an abstract idea—it is a person.</p>

<p>The problem is that the rest was moved.<br>
It is not the first day of the week. It never was.<br>
It is the <strong>seventh day</strong>.</p>

<p>The seventh day is sequential, creational, and memorial. It existed before Israel, before Rome, before any “-ism.” It was preserved not by institutions, but by the power of GOD Himself—just as His Word was preserved, just as His Mercy was preserved. And above all, GOD sent His Son to be—still today—rest, forgiveness, and life for all humanity.</p>

<p>And yet, there is no reason to fear. There is reason to have faith.<br>
Because <strong>GOD IS</strong>.</p>

<p>Faith, in the end, is a personal decision—not because evidence is lacking, but because it is abundant. The universe itself is evidence: the sun we cannot stare at without blindness, the stars, order, life, consciousness.</p>

<p>If someone can see all this and still choose to deny GOD, the issue is not lack of proof, but a decision. Not physical blindness—mental blindness.</p>

<p>For me, the universe is a signature. One unified whole. GOD IS the Creator of the universe, and our Creator.</p>

<p>That is why I chose to order my life differently—placing GOD first not in words, but in actions. Because there is nothing more significant for a human being than to live in a way that pleases the Creator.</p>

<p>That is why I am not a “Christian.”<br>
Not because I reject Christ, but because I follow Him.<br>
Not because I deny GOD, but because I believe that <strong>GOD IS</strong>.</p>
